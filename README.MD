# TensorFlow Deep Neural Network Lab
[<img src="http://yaroslavvb.com/upload/notMNIST/nmn.png" alt="notMNIST dataset samples" />](http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.com/2011/09/notmnist-dataset.html)

We've prepared a Jupyter notebook that will guide you through the process of creating a deep neural network in TensorFlow.

## Instructions

####
Make sure you have followed the instructions in the [classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd209-beta/parts/4405411f-bdc8-43fb-9e2b-b4b98a61c760/modules/375d6b1e-b31a-4d2e-b33a-996167faf77e/lessons/a4a80417-00cb-4a9c-8cc4-3a091414baa2/concepts/b4b04f6b-ed58-483b-acc7-3e5628ed9478) to setup your environment.

#### Run the Notebook
Run the following commands from the same directory as the commands above.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-DNN-Lab.git
$ activate RoboND
$ jupyter notebook
```
The above will open the jupyter interface in your browser from where you can access the Lab folder and the jupyter notebook `DNN_lab.ipynb`

#### Neural Networks Lab
The notebook has 4 problems for you to solve:
 - Problem 1: Normalize the features
 - Problem 2: Use TensorFlow operations to create features, labels, weight, and biases tensors.
 - Problem 3: Implement the hidden and output layers for your model.
 - Problem 4: Tune the learning rate, number of steps, batch size, and dropout's keep_probability value for the best accuracy.

This is a self-assessed lab.
